    "* As expected, mean BMI increases with age, but not substantially. It is interesting that younger people (< 25 years) despite having the lowest mean BMI (30.04) tend to be more underweight (minimal BMI 15.96) or obese (maximal BMI 53.13), that is the spread is higher.\n",
    "* Male population has a higher BMI spread than female population (15.96 - 53.13 vs. 16.82 - 48.07) with a slightly higher mean (30.94 vs. 30.38).\n",
    "* Smokers do not have a substantially higher mean BMI than non-smokers (30.71 vs. 30.65).\n",
    "* BMI seems to rise slightly with the number of children, except one outlier: people with 5 children have the lowest mean BMI (29.61), this group is also the smallest (18). However, when looking at women and men separately, this trend is lost."
